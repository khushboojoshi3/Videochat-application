2. Now the user is asked to enter the room name - The room name entered by the user is checked if this room is already created or not. If there doesn't exist any room with the same name then a new room is created and the user joins in. User can share this unique room name with the person with whom they want to connect.

 Only 2 persons can join a particular room at the same time and if third person tries to enter the room then he/she will get an alert *Room is full, cann't join*
